# Style-Transfer-Art-Startup
## Purpose of the project 
### This project consists of incorporating an existing machine learning model and algorithm, namely fast style transfer, and creating a website which allows users to upload any image of their choice and convert that image into a brand new image with a specific style mixed in. 
## The Algorithm
### The algorithm used for this project is based on Convolutional Neural Networks, which is a class of Deep Neural Networks that work very well for image processing tasks. The components of the project include python files, which contains the code for the neural network algorithm used here to process images (and of course the programming language used). It also required TensorFlow, which is an open source machine learning library we used for our neural network application.
## The framework
### We then used Flask as our web framework for our website implementation, payment system, and SQL database.
